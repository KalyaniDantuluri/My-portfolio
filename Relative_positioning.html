    <!--1.content is everything.
        height(block and inline) and width(inline) of the 
        elements depend on what we write and how much we write
        2.order comes from the code(html).
        3.Children sit on parents.
        i.e.All the html elements that are children 
        they will sit on top of the parent element.
        From top to bottom hierarchy it comes closer and 
        closer to the viewer.

                    4.Fixed
All HTML elements are static in their position by default 
static just means that go along with the HTML rules and keep
to the default HTML flow-->

    <!-- Relative position :
    we can postion the element that we select relative to 
    how it could have been  positioned -->
